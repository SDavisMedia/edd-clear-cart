Adds a Clear Cart link to the Easy Digital Downloads checkout cart.

== Description ==

Built for use with the Easy Digital Downloads plugin, this extension displays a Clear Cart link in the checkout cart and allows you to remove all items from the shopping cart with a single click. You can also choose a page to redirect to once the cart is cleared.

Follow EDD Clear Cart's development on [Github](https://github.com/sdavismedia/edd-clear-cart).

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you have [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) installed.
2. Upload `edd-clear-cart` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Navigate to Downloads -> Settings -> Extensions (tab) in your WordPress dashboard and find the "Clear Cart Settings" section.
5. Adjust your settings and save. You can see the output by viewing your EDD checkout page while you have items in the cart.
